# Coursera-Algorithms
Here are solutions to the course Algorithms (Stanford) on coursera.

However, you shouldn't merely copy them for passing the exams.

I am using the R language.

As for multiple-choice questions, you'd better consult this site https://doraemonzzz.com.

assignment_2.txt is designed for inverstion. When you run the following codes, you will get the answer.

assignment_2 <- read.table("F:/Mine/coursera/Algorithm/assignment_2.txt", quote="\\"", comment.char="")
inversion(assignment_2$V1)

assignment_3 contains the array that you will need for quick_sort. And the correct answer for the coursera test is [162085,164123,138382].
